# Car_Photo_Classification

This project was done for my Machine Learning II class at GalvanizeU (M.S. Data Science program).

I use a convolutional neural net for an image classification problem on photos of cars obtained from the Edmunds API.

First, look at the notebook Car_Photo_Classification_CNN.ipynb. Then move to CNN_with_Image_Augmentation.ipynb.
